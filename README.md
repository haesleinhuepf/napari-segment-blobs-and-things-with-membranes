A plugin based on scikit-image for segmenting nuclei and cells based on fluorescent microscopy images with high intensity in nuclei and/or membranes. 
The available functions and their user interface based on [magicgui](https://napari.org/magicgui/) are shown below. You can also call these functions
as shown in [the demo notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/blob/main/docs/demo.ipynb).

## Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling

This algorithm uses [Otsu's thresholding method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076) in combination with 
[Gaussian blur](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.gaussian) and a 
[Voronoi-Tesselation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) 
approach to label bright objects such as nuclei in an intensity image. The alogrithm has two sigma parameters which allow
you to fine-tune where objects should be cut (`spot_sigma`) and how smooth outlines should be (`outline_sigma`).
This implementation aims to be similar to [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling in clesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb).

## Seeded Watershed

Starting from an image showing high-intensity membranes and a seed-image where objects have been labeled (e.g. using Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling),
objects are labeled that are constrained by the membranes.

## Seeded Watershed using local minima as starting points

Similar to the Seeded Watershed and Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling explained above, you can use this tool to segment an image
showing membranes without an additional image showing nuclei. The two sigma parameters allow to fine tune how close 
objects can be and how precise their boundaries are detected.

## Gaussian blur

Applies a [Gaussian blur](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.gaussian) to an
image. This might be useful for denoising, e.g. before applying the Threshold-Otsu method.

## Subtract background

Subtracts background using [scikit-image's rolling-ball algorithm](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_rolling_ball.html). 
This might be useful, for example to make intensity of membranes more similar in different regions of an image.

## Threshold Otsu

Binarizes an image using [scikit-image's threshold Otsu algorithm](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_thresholding.html), also known as 
[Otsu's method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076).

## Split touching objects (formerly known as binary watershed).

In case objects stick together after thresholding, this tool might help.
It aims to deliver similar results as [ImageJ's watershed implementation](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/process.html#watershed).

## Connected component labeling

Takes a binary image and produces a label image with all separated objects labeled differently. Under the hood, it uses
[scikit-image's label function](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_label.html).
