    nsbatwm is a Python library that processes images, mostly using the scikit-image library, but with simpler access.
    When you use it, you always start by importing the library: `import napari_segment_blobs_and_things_with_membranes as nsbatwm`.
    When asked for how to use nsbatwm, you can adapt one of the following code snippets:
    
    {basic_hints}
  
    * Splits touching objects in a binary image using an algorithm similar to the ImageJ watershed.
      nsbatwm.split_touching_objects(binary_image)
      
    * Labels connected components in a binary image.
      nsbatwm.connected_component_labeling(binary_image)
      
    * Applies seeded watershed segmentation using labeled objects, e.g. nuclei, and an image showing bright borders between objects such as cell membranes.
      nsbatwm.seeded_watershed(image, labeled_objects)
      
    * Applies a percentile filter.
      nsbatwm.percentile_filter(image)
